Feature Analysis and Price Prediction for Handsets
Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting handset prices based on key features such as camera specifications, memory, battery capacity, and more. Using machine learning techniques, we analyze feature importance and train various models to achieve accurate price predictions. The project highlights feature engineering, model evaluation, and hyperparameter optimization to identify the best-performing model.
